        About Us
    </h2>
    <p>
        DEBT MINUS is a consulting Business assisting you in your time of CRISIS with your Debt.  Now this debt might be for you Personal, or your Business, or be for Both.
        Every decision you will take during this time of CRISIS will have an impact on your future.  These decisions are sometimes very simple to take, or they can get really complex due to your own personal situation.
        We are there to LISTEN to your situation, ANALYSE your situation, explain and DEBATE your OPTIONS with you, and then IMPLEMENT the agreed solution or solutions.  It is important that we discuss all alternatives.  You must be FULLY EMPOWERED before we make a decision and then implement the solution.
        We do not work in little BOXES.  We often have to think laterally to find the correct solution for you, we have to develop UNIQUE PRODUCTS such as our Vehicle Rent to Own, or our Sequestration options.
        Sometimes the answer is you do NOTHING and that might not be the answer that you want to hear, but we have to give it in any case.
        At the end this is often a long road we have to walk together, so building a RELATIONSHIP is important. Sometimes you will like what we say, sometimes you might not like what we say.  Just know we will always act with your best interest at heart.
